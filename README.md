## About
This is my try at writing a small multiplayer game with an authorative server and a simpel JavaScript client.
The server is written in TypeScript with Bun as the runtime.
Code is mess... I'm trying to learn both JavaScript and TypeScript at the same time.

## Todo
- ~~Server: Fix fixed tickrate.~~
- Server: Only send updates when gamestate has changed.
- ~~Client: Only send move updates when state/key changes.~~
- ~~Client: Remove Input from gamestate when chatbox is active.~~
- Client/Server: Update and show active players with their colors.
